/**
 * Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.
 *
 * In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
 * Output: 4
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
 * word1 and word2 consist of only lowercase English letters.
