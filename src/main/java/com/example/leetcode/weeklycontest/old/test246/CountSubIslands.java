/**
 * You are given two m x n binary matrices grid1 and grid2 containing only 0's (representing water) and 1's (representing land). An island is a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.
 *
 * An island in grid2 is considered a sub-island if there is an island in grid1 that contains all the cells that make up this island in grid2.
 *
 * Return the number of islands in grid2 that are considered sub-islands.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: grid1 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1,1]], grid2 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.
 * The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are three sub-islands.
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: grid1 = [[1,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0,1]], grid2 = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,1]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.
 * The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are two sub-islands.
